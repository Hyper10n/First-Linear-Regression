# First-Linear-Regression

This is my first Linear Regression project using Sci-kit Learn. I am studying machine learning through https://pythonprogramming.net. The data set I used for the regression is found at https://wiki.csc.calpoly.edu/datasets/wiki/Houses. I chose this data set because it is small enough to iterate quickly through versions of my model and also because it has a small amount of features.

My goal for this project was simply to choose the fatures to use and then train the model. As this is my first independent attempt at linear regression, I am not too concerned about the accuracy.

Feel free to comment or suggest improvements!
